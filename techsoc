<div>What is <em>humanitarian</em> mapping?</div>
<div>Volunteering time to generate <em>geospatial data</em> for parts of the world where it is incomplete or inexistent. 
<notes>As we said, geospatial data is agency. It can be used for proactive measures, like city and community planning, resource
mapping, environmental studies, lobbying for representation, etc. But it can also be used for reactive measure in the wake
of humantiarian crises, when geospatial data is key to first responders on the ground, who at a very basic level, first need
to know where there are residential communities and settlements that need aid, or to be evacuated. Then they need data for
routing, navigation, knowing which roads are passable, etc. By being a humantiarian mapper, you're making this all possible.</div>

<div>What is <em>OpenStreetMap</em>? Why OSM? </div>

<div>OSM is like Wikipedia for maps. It's all <a href='http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/'>open data</a>!</div
